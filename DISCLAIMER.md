# Disclaimer

## Experimental Software

Opaque is **experimental, unaudited software** provided on an "as-is" basis. It has **not** undergone a formal security audit. Use it at your own risk.

## No Guarantees of Privacy

While the protocol is designed to provide unlinkable receive addresses and selective disclosure of reputation, **no privacy system is perfect**. Specific risks include:

- **Metadata leakage.** On-chain transactions carry timing, amount, and fee-payer information that sophisticated observers may use for statistical linkage analysis.
- **Local data loss.** Ghost addresses rely on local device storage. Lost data may make funds **permanently inaccessible** with no on-chain recovery.
- **Scanner limitations.** The WASM scanner depends on complete announcement data from RPC or Horizon. Missed events may delay detection until a rescan.
- **View-tag false positives.** Roughly 1 in 256 announcements pass the view-tag filter without being yours, requiring full derivation to confirm.

## Cryptographic Assumptions

Security relies on:

- **ECDLP hardness** on secp256k1.
- **Groth16 soundness** on BN254 with a trusted setup (development artifacts in-repo are not production-ready).
- **Keccak-256** and **Poseidon** collision resistance.

## Smart Contract Risks

Soroban contracts deployed on Stellar testnet have **not been formally verified**. Risks include logic bugs, admin-controlled Merkle roots, growing nullifier state, and upgrade authority if contracts are not immutable.

## Not Financial Advice

Nothing here is financial, legal, or tax advice. Comply with applicable laws in your jurisdiction.

## Testnet Only

Default configuration targets **Stellar testnet**. Test XLM has no monetary value. Do not send mainnet funds to experimental deployments until you have completed your own security review.
